    <h1>Kericho County is located in the highlands of western Kenya, and has a temperate climate due to its elevation. 
        The county is known for its tea and coffee plantations, but other crops can also thrive depending on the season and weather conditions. Here are some suggestions for crops to plant in different weather seasons in Kericho County:</h1>

     <ol>
        <li class="JUS">Rainy Season (March to June, October to December)</li>
          <h3>During the rainy season, the weather in Kericho County is cool and moist, which is ideal for growing crops that require high humidity and consistent moisture.
             Here are some crops that thrive during this season:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Tea: Tea is the primary cash crop in Kericho County, and the rainy season is the best time to plant it. 
                Tea requires a lot of water, so the rainy season provides the necessary moisture for the tea bushes to grow and produce high-quality leaves.</li>
            <li>Coffee: Coffee also thrives in the cool, moist weather of the rainy season.
                 However, coffee is more sensitive to waterlogged soils than tea, so proper drainage is necessary to prevent root rot.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: The rainy season is a good time to plant vegetables like kales, spinach, and cabbages.
                 These crops require a lot of moisture and do well in the cool weather of Kericho County..</li>
            <li>Maize: Maize can also be planted during the rainy season, but it requires well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging.</li>
         </ul>
     </ol>
    <ol class="DryJam">Dry Season (January to February, July to September)</ol>
     <h5>During the dry season, the weather in Kericho County is dry and warm, which can be challenging for crops that require high moisture levels. However, some crops can still thrive during this season if they are properly irrigated.
         Here are some crops that can be planted during the dry season:</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>Beans: Beans are a good crop to plant during the dry season because they require less water than other crops. 
                However, they still need to be irrigated regularly to produce a good yield.</li>
           <li>Beans: Beans are a good crop to plant during the dry season because they require less water than other crops.
             However, they still need to be irrigated regularly to produce a good yield.</li>
           <li>Onions: Onions are a good crop to plant during the dry season because they require less water than other vegetables.
             They can be grown from seeds or sets and can be harvested after 3-4 months.</li>
       </ul>
   <h5>Kericho County does not experience a hot season as the county is located in the highlands, which has a temperate climate throughout the year.
     The temperature in Kericho County ranges from 10째C to 26째C (50째F to 79째F) throughout the year, with the coldest months being June and July and the warmest months being December and January. 
     However, during the dry season, the weather can be warm and dry during the day, and cooler at night, so crops that are drought-resistant and can tolerate fluctuating temperatures would be suitable. Sorghum, millet, beans, and cowpeas are crops that can be grown in such conditions. However, these crops would still require proper irrigation to survive and produce a good yield.</h5>
